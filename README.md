## THREEJS-SIMPLE-BOILER

I know I know, there exists soo many ThreeJS boiler plate outta there...But this one is simply my diary on learning these stuffs at once:

* ES6
* ThreeJS
* Bundler (Webpack in this case...I know I know...)
* Debugging JS

## HOW-TO RUN

Make sure you have `npm` and `node` installed. I am using Python 3.9 virtual environment with `nodeenv` package. 

Once you have all set then just run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev --> for running
$ npm run build --> for building 
```
